# Bubbergames
A unblocked gaming site for you that self hosts over 200+ games from reliable sources.


## Bubbergames Purpose?
We are mainly a service that provides games completely self hosted but we also have a proxy!

You're mainly supposed to use our site at places that have restrictions.

## Bubbergames Sourced
- We use Space's Typescript setup.
- We use Brunysixlwork's static proxy setup which is based off of Titanium Network's ultraviolet proxy.
- We use a bare proxy server that links to Benrogo's proxy
- We use games from Math 66 Games, 3kh0, and the old Selenete.cc
- We owe our now.gg bypass to Frogie's Arcade

i owe it all to pete zah.
